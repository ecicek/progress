  given a verification system, it can give the refinement system
  t Sat S : term t satisfies spec S
  Gamma |- e : &tau; can be thought of one refinement system where t= e, and spec is gamma and type
  Refinement calculi u [= u&#8217; is apartial order where u satisfier some spec, and u&#8217; is a refined
  version which will also satisfier spec S as u but more&#8230;
  modular verification is important for composibility</p>

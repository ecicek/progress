    sep. logic  can express disjointedness and sharing
    build on Matthew Parkinson's logic system
    correct by construction programs
    given a verification system, it can give the refinement system
    t Sat S : term t satisfies spec S
     Gamma |- e : \tau can be thought of one refinement system where t= e, and spec is gamma and type
    Refinement calculi u [= u' is apartial order where u satisfier some spec, and u' is a refined
    version which will also satisfier spec S as u but more...
    modular verification is important for composibility
   

** fixed bugs on the server machine with mlton and cm2mlb, took ages, see NOTES in src directory 
** going over the paper draft
** fucked up the svn, terrible rm -rf mistake on the old svn directory which was soft linked to the esop on home
   
*  <2013-09-26 Thu>
** modified the paper: additions to the type system and intoduction/organiation of the paper
** fixed the bug in the code with the foldrStable, the problem was that I didn't know how to pass the proper arguments to the lifting function. 
** Talk by John Wilkes from Google, he talked about the failures and system wise problems in the Google infrastructure.  :talk:

** finished matrix-multiplication experiment, 
   now changes are only at single cells, propagation occurs after every touch.
   instead on O(N) complexitiy, I get predicted O(nlogn) complexity
** worked on fixing gnu plot problems, fitting functionality learned 
   changing colors, setting function labels with fitted coefficients learned
** started on transpose experiment
** DONE zip_cons in Transpose.sml
** TODO finish transpose example
*** TODO fix run types for verifier, no need to have paired matrices
** TODO send Deepak and Umut graphs with matrix_multipl, dot_product, and transpose
  explain why we're getting the results
** TODO go over UMut's scanned review
